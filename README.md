# RefRouteChains
## About
Navigation of successive reference routes

This Android sample app shows how easy it is to develop a custom navigation solution using the MapTrip Interface (MTI).

In reality, this navigation solution could be used to guide buses from stop to stop or waste disposal vehicles on their tour. A prerequisite is the simultaneous installation of the navigation software MapTrip from infoware.

The company infoware GmbH provides various tools for recording the reference routes.

The development took place in the Android Studio of JetBrains.

## Description of the application
More details about the application itself are in the file DESCRIPTION.md.

## Integration MTI
The integration of the MapTrip interface into the app is explained in the document HOW_TO_APP.
